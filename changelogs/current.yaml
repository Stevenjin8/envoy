  change: |
    for the :ref:`strict DNS <arch_overview_service_discovery_types_strict_dns>` and :ref:`logical DNS
    <arch_overview_service_discovery_types_logical_dns>` cluster types,
    the new :ref:`dns_jitter <envoy_v3_api_field_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.dns_jitter>` field, if
    provided, will causes the cluster to refresh DNS entries later by a random amount of time as to
    avoid stampedes of DNS requests. This field sets the upper bound (exclusive) for the random amount.
